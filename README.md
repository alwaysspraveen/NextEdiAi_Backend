# 🚀 Backend API — Node.js & Express

A powerful, scalable backend server built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, designed to provide RESTful APIs for web and mobile applications. This backend can handle authentication, CRUD operations, real-time features, and more.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-backend.git
cd your-backend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following keys:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:4200
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Server

### Development mode (with nodemon):

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production mode:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on:
👉 `http://localhost:5000`

## 📡 API Endpoints

### 🔐 Auth Routes

| Method | Endpoint             | Description                  |
| ------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/auth/register` | Register a new user          |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`    | Authenticate and get a token |
| GET    | `/api/auth/me`       | Get logged-in user profile   |

### 🧑‍💻 User Routes

| Method | Endpoint         | Description           |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/users`     | Get all users (admin) |
| GET    | `/api/users/:id` | Get user by ID        |
| PUT    | `/api/users/:id` | Update user details   |
| DELETE | `/api/users/:id` | Delete a user         |

*(Add more routes here based on your modules — e.g., tickets, assets, orders, etc.)*

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

| Command        | Description                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `npm start`    | Start production server               |
| `npm run dev`  | Start development server with nodemon |
| `npm run lint` | Lint the project files                |
| `npm run test` | Run test suites                       |

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Node.js** — Runtime
* **Express.js** — Server framework
* **MongoDB / Mongoose** — Database and ODM
* **JWT** — Authentication
* **bcryptjs** — Password hashing
* **dotenv** — Environment management
* **Cors / Helmet** — Security

---

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

* All sensitive data stored in `.env`
* Passwords hashed with `bcryptjs`
* JWT tokens used for authentication
* CORS configured for allowed origins
* Input validated on all endpoints

---

## 🧪 Testing (Optional)

If you have test scripts configured:

```bash
npm run test
```

---

## 📤 Deployment

To deploy on a cloud provider (e.g., **Render**, **Vercel**, **Railway**, or **AWS EC2**):

1. Set environment variables on the hosting platform.
2. Run the build/start script.
3. Point your frontend or mobile app to the deployed base URL.
